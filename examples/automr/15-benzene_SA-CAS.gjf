#p CASSCF(6,6)/cc-pVTZ

mokit{ist=5,readno='benzene_uhf_gvb15_CASSCF_NO.fch',DryRun,Nstate=2}

# This example shows how to generate SA-CASSCF input file for excited state
#  calculations. If you want to perform a NEVPT2 calculation, just replace
#  CASSCF by NEVPT2.
#
# DryRun means exiting the main program after input file generated.
#
# Nstate=2 means averaging states S0/S1. If you want to average S0/T1, you
#  should add the keyword Mixed_Spin.
#
# If you want to use other CASSCF programs, e.g. ORCA, just add the keyword
#  CASSCF_prog=ORCA
#
# To run this example, Gaussian, GAMESS and PySCF should be installed.
