#p CASSCF(6,6)/cc-pVDZ

mokit{ist=5,readno='ben_cc-pVDZ_uhf_gvb15_CASSCF_NO.fch',Nstates=5}

# This example shows how to perform SA-CASSCF computations. It assumes that you
#  have already accomplished the ground state CASSCF calculation and obtain the
#  file ben_cc-pVDZ_uhf_gvb15_CASSCF_NO.fch.
# 
# If you want to perform the NEVPT2 calculation, just replace CASSCF by NEVPT2.
#
# Nstate=3 means averaging states S0/S1/S2. If you want to average S0/T1, you
#  should add the keyword Mixed_Spin.
#
# If you want to use other CASSCF programs, e.g. ORCA, just add the keyword
#  CASSCF_prog=ORCA
#
# To run this example, Gaussian, GAMESS and PySCF should be installed.
