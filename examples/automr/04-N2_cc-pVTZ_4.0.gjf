# Of course, you can read in a truly UHF wave function. Initial guess constructed
# from each fragment is used in the provided .fch file. Note that for d(N-N)=4.0A
# there exists multiple UHF solutions. In this way the lowest UHF energy solution
# can be obtained and provided.

# To run this example, GAMESS and PySCF need to be installed
