# This example shows you how to read MOs from a given UHF .fch(k) file and
# perform CASSCF computation with background charges. The Gaussian .fch(k)
# file has a defect that background charges are not stored in. Thus we have
# to provide them in the input

# To run this example, you need to install PySCF and GAMESS
