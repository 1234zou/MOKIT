# This example shows you how to read MOs from a provided UHF .fch(k) file
# The UHF wave function in N2_cc-pVDZ_1.0_uhf.fchk is actually equivalent
# to RHF, <S**2>=0. AutoMR will automatically check the equivalence and switch
# {ist=3,readrhf}. So here results will be equal to those from 02-N2_cc-pVDZ_1.0.gjf

# To run this example, you need to install PySCF and GAMESS
