# Transfer MOs from PySCF to ORCA
# Note: the Bohr constant is different between PySCF/MOKIT v.s. ORCA, so the
# difference of the nuclear repulsion energy may be as large as 1e-5 ~ 1e-6 a.u.
# which is usually larger than the difference of electronic energies. If you
# observe a 1e-5 ~ 1e-6 a.u. total energy difference between PySCF/ORCA, it is
# likely due to the Bohr constant. You can find the nuclear repulsion energy
# both in PySCF and ORCA output file, and make a comparison.
